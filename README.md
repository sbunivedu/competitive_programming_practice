Dr. Lu registered "SBU purple" and "SBU violet" teams for 2022 ICPC Mid-central contest (Feb. 25 1-6pm at SBU).

Andrew recommended the following material (printed) to bring to the contest:
* A math [formula sheet](https://coralgables-sh.enschool.org/ourpages/auto/2017/5/17/53540930/Math%20HL%20formula%20booklet.pdf)(e.g. this one, though it is much longer than you would ever need)
* A textbook in the programming language you are going to use (if you have one)
* Lots of previous example problems ([here](https://github.com/AndrewEisenhour/portfolio/tree/main/ICPC) are a bunch of my old solutions)
* A few key algorithms, especially Dijkstra's, could be useful to have (I have a couple versions in that repository)
* An [ASCII table](https://www.asciitable.com/)
* That should cover a lot of it for people. Obviously, the more you bring, the better prepared you will be. Too much stuff can make it hard to search through though. At least people should bring an example program that takes input, does something with it, and gives output. That will help with the brain farts that happen in competition when people forgot how to use a scanner.

Dr. Lu worked on a plan to go over a book solving and studying typical
contest problems. Here are the resources:
* Book http://acm.cs.buap.mx/downloads/Programming_Challenges.pdf
* Judging site https://onlinejudge.org/
* Debugging site https://www.udebug.com/

Dr. Lu worked on the "3n+1" at the end of chapter 1. If you are interested,
please give it a try to see whether you can pass the judge (https://onlinejudge.org/).
Dr. Lu ran into some interesting problems and has a "mystery" for you to solve
(two seemingly equivalent solutions, one passes the judge and the other fails).
Solutions to the problems and related discussions will appear in this repository:

## 8/22/22
Participants: Andrew, Drew, Joel, Josiah, Elijah, Jake, and Dr. Lu

Andrew gave short introductions to the different competitions we participate in
([ICPC](https://icpc.global/), [CCSC](https://www.ccsc.org/centralplains/programming-contest/),
and [Federal Reserve Bank Code-A-Thon](https://www.kansascityfed.org/about-us/code-a-thon/#:~:text=The%20Kansas%20City%20Fed%20Code,that%20solve%20real%2Dlife%20problems.)).

Andrew talked through the following two problems (one easy, one hard) as examples of ICPC style competition problems:
* [Basketball One-on-One](https://open.kattis.com/problems/basketballoneonone) from [2019 ICPC Mid-Central Regional](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/2019%20ICPC%20Mid-Central%20Regional)
* [Crazed Boar](https://open.kattis.com/problems/crazedboar) from [2019 ICPC Mid-Central Regional](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/2019%20ICPC%20Mid-Central%20Regional)

The next Mid-Central Regional will take place in spring 2023 (Feb., or March). The team wants to find another competition to go to this fall or have skirmishes among our own teams.

Joel showed Elijah and Jake how to practice coding on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Joel also showed cased some cool games he wrote on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) when he was in high school.
