Team A (Andrew, Drew, Josiah) continued tinkering on the "Bracket Pairing" problem.

Team B (Joel, John) solved the "Ultimate Binary Watch" and the "Concert Rehearsal"
problems from https://ncna21.kattis.com/contests/ncna21/problems

Team C (Jake, Elijah, Deacon) solved the "Minesweeper" problem from chapter 1 of http://acm.cs.buap.mx/downloads/Programming_Challenges.pdf and learned an important lesson on "presentation error".

## 10/11/22
Participants: Andrew, Drew, Joel, Josiah, Elijah, Jake, John, and Dr. Lu

Team A (Andrew, Drew, Josiah, Joel) tinkered on the "Bracket Pairing" problem.

Team B (Joel, John) solved the "Espresso" problem.

Team C (Jake, Elijah) solved the "3n+1" from chapter 1 of http://acm.cs.buap.mx/downloads/Programming_Challenges.pdf. The [solution](https://gist.github.com/lubaochuan/48a405f9214236af90b3857ebd663ade) was accepted on https://onlinejudge.org/

## 10/4/22
Participants: Andrew, Joel, Elijah, Jake, Deacon, and Dr. Lu

## 9/27/22
Participants: Andrew, Drew, Joel, Josiah, Elijah, Jake, Deacon, Jacob, and Dr. Lu

Team A (Andrew, Drew, Josiah, Joel) solved the "Parking Lot" problem, hooray!

Team B (Joel, Jacob), chewed on "Lone Rook" problem.

Team C (Jake, Elijah, Deacon) chewed on "Lone Rook" problem.

Dr. Lu worked on a plan to go over a book solving and studying typical 
contest problems. Here are the resources:
* Book http://acm.cs.buap.mx/downloads/Programming_Challenges.pdf
* Judging site https://onlinejudge.org/
* Debugging site https://www.udebug.com/

Dr. Lu worked on the "3n+1" at the end of chapter 1. If you are interested, 
please give it a try to see whether you can pass the judge (https://onlinejudge.org/).
Dr. Lu ran into some interesting problems and has a "mystery" for you to solve
(two seemingly equivalent solutions, one passes the judge and the other fails).
Solutions to the problems and related discussions will appear in this repository:

## 9/20/22
Participants: Andrew, Drew, Joel, Josiah, Elijah, Jake, Deacon, and Dr. Lu

All three teams continued working on the [2021 North Central Regional problem set](https://ncna21.kattis.com/contests/ncna21/problems).

Team A (Andrew, Drew, Josiah, Joel) three-quarter-solved the "Parking Lot" problem.

Team C (Jake, Elijah, Deacon) worked on "Lone Rook" problem.

Here are some [books](books.md) and [training sites](sites.md) for competitive programming. 

## 9/13/22
Participants: Andrew, Drew, Joel, Josiah, Elijah, Jake, John, Jacob, Calvin, and Dr. Lu

All three teams continued working on the [2021 North Central Regional problem set](https://ncna21.kattis.com/contests/ncna21/problems).

Team A (Andrew, Drew, Josiah) half-solved the "Parking Lot" problem and worked on the "Bracket Pairing" problem.

Team B (Joel, John, Calvin, Jacob) re-solved "Stream Lag" and solved "Code Guessing".

Team C (Jake, Elijah) solved "Subprime" for the sample test cases, but the solution is not efficient for larger test cases.

## 9/6/22
Participants: Andrew, Drew, Joel, Josiah, Elijah, Jake, John, and Dr. Lu

All three teams continued working on the [2021 North Central Regional problem set](https://ncna21.kattis.com/contests/ncna21/problems).

Team A (Andrew, Drew, Josiah) solved the "Land Equality" problem and worked on the "Subprime" problem.

[Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://www.baeldung.com/java-generate-prime-numbers) is an efficient method (`O(nlogn)`) for finding all primes numbers up to a limit.

Here is a [commentary](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~bcsandlu/2-26-22_editorial.pdf) on the problem set.

Team B (Joel, John) solved "Stream Lag".

Team C (Jake, Elijah) solved "Stream Lag" and "Code Guessing".

## 8/29/22
Participants: Andrew, Drew, Joel, Josiah, Elijah, Jake, Jacob, and Dr. Lu

Three team were formed to work on the [2021 North Central Regional problem set](https://ncna21.kattis.com/contests/ncna21/problems).

Team A (Andrew, Drew, Josiah) solved Ultimate Binary Watch ([solution](./src/UltimateBinaryWatch.java) for Team C to look at), Espresso!, Code Guessing, Stream Log.

Team B (Joel, Jacob) solved Ultimate Binary Watch.

Team C (Jake, Elijah) solved Ultimate Binary Watch and Espresso!.

Team A plans to practice on this problem set next week aiming to solve harder problems.

We discovered similar problem sets that can be used for future practice:

## 8/22/22
Participants: Andrew, Drew, Joel, Josiah, Elijah, Jake, and Dr. Lu

Andrew gave short introductions to the different competitions we participate in 
([ICPC](https://icpc.global/), [CCSC](https://www.ccsc.org/centralplains/programming-contest/),
and [Federal Reserve Bank Code-A-Thon](https://www.kansascityfed.org/about-us/code-a-thon/#:~:text=The%20Kansas%20City%20Fed%20Code,that%20solve%20real%2Dlife%20problems.)).

Andrew talked through the following two problems (one easy, one hard) as examples of ICPC style competition problems:
* [Basketball One-on-One](https://open.kattis.com/problems/basketballoneonone) from [2019 ICPC Mid-Central Regional](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/2019%20ICPC%20Mid-Central%20Regional)
* [Crazed Boar](https://open.kattis.com/problems/crazedboar) from [2019 ICPC Mid-Central Regional](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/2019%20ICPC%20Mid-Central%20Regional)

The next Mid-Central Regional will take place in spring 2023 (Feb., or March). The team wants to find another competition to go to this fall or have skirmishes among our own teams.

Joel showed Elijah and Jake how to practice coding on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Joel also showed cased some cool games he wrote on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) when he was in high school.
