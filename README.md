# Competitive Programming Meeting Minutes

## 8/29/22
Participants: Andrew, Drew, Joel, Josiah, Elijah, Jake, Jacob, and Dr. Lu

Three team were formed to work on the [2021 North Central Regional problem set](https://ncna21.kattis.com/contests/ncna21).

Team A (Andrew, Drew, Josiah) solved Ultimate Binary Watch ([solution](./src/UltimateBinaryWatch.java) for Team C to look at), Espresso!, Code Guessing, Stream Log.

Team B (Joel, Jacob) solved Ultimate Binary Watch.

Team C (Jake, Elijah) solved Ultimate Binary Watch and Espresso!.

Team A plans to practice on this problem set next week aiming to solve harder problems.

We discovered similar problem sets that can be used for future practice:

## 8/22/22
Participants: Andrew, Drew, Joel, Josiah, Elijah, Jake, and Dr. Lu

Andrew gave short introductions to the different competitions we participate in 
([ICPC](https://icpc.global/), [CCSC](https://www.ccsc.org/centralplains/programming-contest/),
and [Federal Reserve Bank Code-A-Thon](https://www.kansascityfed.org/about-us/code-a-thon/#:~:text=The%20Kansas%20City%20Fed%20Code,that%20solve%20real%2Dlife%20problems.)).

Andrew talked through the following two problems (one easy, one hard) as examples of ICPC style competition problems:
* [Basketball One-on-One](https://open.kattis.com/problems/basketballoneonone) from [2019 ICPC Mid-Central Regional](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/2019%20ICPC%20Mid-Central%20Regional)
* [Crazed Boar](https://open.kattis.com/problems/crazedboar) from [2019 ICPC Mid-Central Regional](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/2019%20ICPC%20Mid-Central%20Regional)

The next Mid-Central Regional will take place in spring 2023 (Feb., or March). The team wants to find another competition to go to this fall or have skirmishes among our own teams.

Joel showed Elijah and Jake how to practice coding on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Joel also showed cased some cool games he wrote on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) when he was in high school.
