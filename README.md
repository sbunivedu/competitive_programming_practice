Reviewed AI solution to https://open.kattis.com/problems/10kindsofpeople and the explanation+tracing at https://github.com/sbunivedu/ICPC_practice/tree/main/10kindsofpeople

Lessons learned:
* Use breadth-first search to avoid recursive depth-first search, which may cause stack overflow.
* Use pre-processing to avoid repeated traversals.

Everyone solved https://open.kattis.com/problems/3dprinter

## 9/3/25
Participants: Micah, Lucas, and Dr. Lu

## 9/2/25
Participants: Luke, Remington, and Dr. Lu

Remington explored various learning resources to catch up on python.

* https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/python-for-everybody/
* https://codingbat.com/python
* https://leetcode.com/problemset/

These two are linked by the official python.org website
* https://python.land/python-tutorial
* https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers

This is a very good site. It has interactive elements even better then freecodecamp in my opinion. However, after the first couple of chapters, the interactive elements are locked behind a paywall. After that, all of the videos, documentation, and sample code are still free for use.

Lucas worked on exercise problems on codingbat. He found out
the "Python Basics" learning path on realpython.com is not completely free.
The Python for Everybody at https://www.py4e.com/ is completely free
and it is also featured on freecodecamp.org at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/python-for-everybody/

## 8/27/24
Participants: Josiah, Jake, Luke, Lucas, Alex, Jayna, and Dr. Lu

Josiah, Jake, Luke worked together on some past contest problems
and brainstormed about hackthons.

Lucas will work with Alex to gain working knowledge of Python
as quickly as possible. Lucas started with the Python track on
codingbat: https://codingbat.com/python Other good resources include:
* "Python Basics" learning path on realpython.com at https://realpython.com/learning-paths/python-basics/
* "Legacy Python for Everybody" course on freecodecamp.org at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/python-for-everybody/
* https://replit.com/~ is good online coding playground for Python
and many other languages.

Jayna will work with Dr. Lu to create a practice plan as she
had to leave early for band pratice.
"Leetcode 75" study plan at https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/
should be a good starting point.

Dr. Lu registered "SBU purple" and "SBU violet" teams for 2022 ICPC Mid-central contest (Feb. 25 1-6pm at SBU).

Andrew recommended the following material (printed) to bring to the contest:
* A math [formula sheet](https://coralgables-sh.enschool.org/ourpages/auto/2017/5/17/53540930/Math%20HL%20formula%20booklet.pdf)(e.g. this one, though it is much longer than you would ever need)
* A textbook in the programming language you are going to use (if you have one)
* Lots of previous example problems ([here](https://github.com/AndrewEisenhour/portfolio/tree/main/ICPC) are a bunch of my old solutions)
* A few key algorithms, especially Dijkstra's, could be useful to have (I have a couple versions in that repository)
* An [ASCII table](https://www.asciitable.com/)
* That should cover a lot of it for people. Obviously, the more you bring, the better prepared you will be. Too much stuff can make it hard to search through though. At least people should bring an example program that takes input, does something with it, and gives output. That will help with the brain farts that happen in competition when people forgot how to use a scanner.

## 11/15/22

Dr. Lu ran into some interesting problems and has a "mystery" for you to solve
(two seemingly equivalent solutions, one passes the judge and the other fails).
Solutions to the problems and related discussions will appear in this repository:
https://github.com/sbunivedu/ICPC_practice

## 8/22/22
Participants: Andrew, Drew, Joel, Josiah, Elijah, Jake, and Dr. Lu

Andrew gave short introductions to the different competitions we participate in
([ICPC](https://icpc.global/), [CCSC](https://www.ccsc.org/centralplains/programming-contest/),
and [Federal Reserve Bank Code-A-Thon](https://www.kansascityfed.org/about-us/code-a-thon/#:~:text=The%20Kansas%20City%20Fed%20Code,that%20solve%20real%2Dlife%20problems.)).

Andrew talked through the following two problems (one easy, one hard) as examples of ICPC style competition problems:
* [Basketball One-on-One](https://open.kattis.com/problems/basketballoneonone) from [2019 ICPC Mid-Central Regional](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/2019%20ICPC%20Mid-Central%20Regional)
* [Crazed Boar](https://open.kattis.com/problems/crazedboar) from [2019 ICPC Mid-Central Regional](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources/2019%20ICPC%20Mid-Central%20Regional)

The next Mid-Central Regional will take place in spring 2023 (Feb., or March). The team wants to find another competition to go to this fall or have skirmishes among our own teams.

Joel showed Elijah and Jake how to practice coding on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Joel also showed cased some cool games he wrote on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) when he was in high school.
